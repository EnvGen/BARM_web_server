One is an inserted four helix bundle, which is the least well conserved region of the alignment, between residues 16 and 96 of Pseudomonas sp. (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase 1. The rest of the fold is composed of the core alpha/beta domain. Those members with the characteristic DxD triad at the N-terminus are probably phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) phosphatases involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis in the mitochondria.

The family includes: Nitrilase EC:3.5.5.1, Aliphatic amidase EC:3.5.1.4, Biotidinase EC:3.5.1.12, Beta-ureidopropionase EC:3.5.1.6.

Therefore this family are likely to also be MS channel proteins.
pfam01207	Dus	Dihydrouridine synthase (Dus). Members of this family catalyse the reduction of the 5,6-double bond of a uridine residue on tRNA. Dihydrouridine modification of tRNA is widely observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and also in some archae. Most dihydrouridines are found in the D loop of t-RNAs. The role of dihydrouridine in tRNA is currently unknown, but may increase conformational flexibility of the tRNA. It is likely that different family members have different substrate specificities, which may overlap. Dus 1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts on pre-tRNA-Phe, while Dus 2 acts on pre-tRNA-Tyr and pre-tRNA-Leu. Dus 1 is active as a single subunit, requiring NADPH or NADH, and is stimulated by the presence of FAD. Some family members may be targeted to the mitochondria and even have a role in mitochondria.

Members of this family are probably proteases (after a isoprenyl group is attached to the Cys residue in the C-terminal CAAX motif of a protein to attach it to the membrane, the AAX tripeptide being removed by one of the CAAX prenyl proteases). The family contains the CAAX prenyl protease. The proteins contain a highly conserved Glu-Glu motif at the amino end of the alignment. The alignment also contains two histidine residues that may be involved in zinc binding. While they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. In some known bacteriocin loci, Abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes where they are probably involved in self-immunity. Investigation of the bacteriocin-like loci in the Gram positive bacteria locus from Lactobacillus sakei 23K confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (sak23Kalphabeta) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated Abi gene (sak23Ki) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. Interestingly, the immunity genes from three similar systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the Abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of Sak23Ki - thus a new concept in self-immunity.
pfam02518	HATPase_c	Histidine kinase-, DNA gyrase B-, and HSP90-like ATPase. This family represents the structurally related ATPase domains of histidine kinase, DNA gyrase B and HSP90.

Light chain 3 is proposed to function primarily as a subunit of microtubule associated proteins 1A and 1B and that its expression may regulate microtubule binding activity. Autophagy is generally known as a process involved in the degradation of bulk cytoplasmic components that are non-specifically sequestered into an autophagosome, where they are sequestered into double-membrane vesicles and delivered to the degradative organelle, the lysosome/vacuole, for breakdown and eventual recycling of the resulting macromolecules. The yeast proteins are involved in the autophagosome, and Atg8 binds Atg19, via its N-terminus and the C-terminus of Atg19.

A pair of cysteine residues show correlated conservation, suggesting that they form a disulphide bond.
pfam04012	PspA_IM30	PspA/IM30 family. This family includes PspA a protein that suppresses sigma54-dependent transcription. The PspA protein, a negative regulator of the Escherichia coli phage shock psp operon, is produced when virulence factors are exported through secretins in many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and its homologue in plants, VIPP1, plays a critical role in thylakoid biogenesis, essential for photosynthesis. Activation of transcription by the enhancer-dependent bacterial sigma(54) containing RNA polymerase occurs through ATP hydrolysis-driven protein conformational changes enabled by activator proteins that belong to the large AAA(+) mechanochemical protein family. It has been shown that PspA directly and specifically acts upon and binds to the AAA(+) domain of the PspF transcription activator.
pfam04402	SIMPL	Protein of unknown function (DUF541). Members of this family have so far been found in bacteria and mouse SwissProt or TrEMBL entries. However possible family members have also been identified in translated rat (Genbank:AW144450) and human (Genbank:AI478629) ESTs. A mouse family member has been named SIMPL (signalling molecule that associates with mouse pelle-like kinase). SIMPL appears to facilitate and/or regulate complex formation between IRAK/mPLK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) and IKK (inhibitor of kappa-B kinase) containing complexes, and thus regulate NF-kappa-B activity. Separate experiments demonstrate that a mouse family member (named LaXp180) binds the Listeria monocytogenes surface protein ActA, which is a virulence factor that induces actin polymerization. It may also bind stathmin, a protein involved in signal transduction and in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. In bacteria its function is unknown, but it is thought to be located in the periplasm or outer membrane.
pfam04519	Bactofilin	Polymer-forming cytoskeletal. This is a family of bactofilins, a functionally diverse class of cytoskeletal, polymer-forming, proteins that is widely conserved among bacteria. In the example species C. crescentus, two bactofilins assemble into a membrane-associated laminar structure that shows cell-cycle-dependent polar localisation and acts as a platform for the recruitment of a cell wall biosynthetic enzyme involved in polar morphogenesis. Bactofilins display distinct subcellular distributions and dynamics in different bacterial species, suggesting that they are versatile structural elements that have adopted a range of different cellular functions.

pfam10418	DHODB_Fe-S_bind	Iron-sulfur cluster binding domain of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B. Lactococcus lactis is one of the few organisms with two dihydroorotate dehydrogenases, DHODs, A and B. The B enzyme is a prototype for DHODs in Gram-positive bacteria that use NAD+ as the second substrate. DHODB is a hetero-tetramer composed of a central homodimer of PyrDB subunits resembling the DHODA structure and two PyrK subunits along with three different cofactors: FMN, FAD, and a [2Fe-2S] cluster. The [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster binds to this C-terminal domain of the PyrK subunit, which is at the interface between the flavin and NAD binding domains and contains three beta-strands. The four cysteine residues at the N-terminal part of this domain are the ones that bind, in pairs, to the iron-sulfur cluster. The conformation of the whole molecule means that the iron-sulfur cluster is localized in a well-ordered part of this domain close to the FAD binding site.

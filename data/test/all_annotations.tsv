pfam00001	7tm_1	7 transmembrane receptor (rhodopsin family). This family contains, amongst other G-protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs), members of the opsin family, which have been considered to be typical members of the rhodopsin superfamily. They share several motifs, mainly the seven transmembrane helices, GCPRs of the rhodopsin superfamily. All opsins bind a chromophore, such as 11-cis-retinal. The function of most opsins other than the photoisomerases is split into two steps: light absorption and G-protein activation. Photoisomerases, on the other hand, are not coupled to G-proteins - they are thought to generate and supply the chromophore that is used by visual opsins.
pfam00002	7tm_2	7 transmembrane receptor (Secretin family). This family is known as Family B, the secretin-receptor family or family 2 of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs).They have been described in many animal species, but not in plants, fungi or prokaryotes. Three distinct sub-families are recognized. Subfamily B1 contains classical hormone receptors, such as receptors for secretin and glucagon, that are all involved in cAMP-mediated signalling pathways. Subfamily B2 contains receptors with long extracellular N-termini, such as the leukocyte cell-surface antigen CD97; calcium-independent receptors for latrotoxin, and brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitors amongst others. Subfamily B3 includes Methuselah and other Drosophila proteins. Other than the typical seven-transmembrane region, characteristic structural features include an amino-terminal extracellular domain involved in ligand binding, and an intracellular loop (IC3) required for specific G-protein coupling.
pfam00003	7tm_3	7 transmembrane sweet-taste receptor of 3 GCPR. This is a domain of seven transmembrane regions that forms the C-terminus of some subclass 3 G-coupled-protein receptors. It is often associated with a downstream cysteine-rich linker domain, NCD3G pfam07562, which is the human sweet-taste receptor, and the N-terminal domain, ANF_receptor pfam01094. The seven TM regions assemble in such a way as to produce a docking pocket into which such molecules as cyclamate and lactisole have been found to bind and consequently confer the taste of sweetness.
TIGR00001	rpmI_bact	ribosomal protein L35. This ribosomal protein is found in bacteria and organelles only. It is not closely related to any eukaryotic or archaeal ribosomal protein [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification].
TIGR00002	S16	ribosomal protein S16. This model describes ribosomal S16 of bacteria and organelles [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification].
TIGR00003	TIGR00003	copper ion binding protein. This model describes an apparently copper-specific subfamily of the metal-binding domain HMA (pfam00403). Closely related sequences outside this model include mercury resistance proteins and repeated domains of eukaryotic eukaryotic copper transport proteins. Members of this family are strictly prokaryotic. The model identifies both small proteins consisting of just this domain and N-terminal regions of cation (probably copper) transporting ATPases [Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds].

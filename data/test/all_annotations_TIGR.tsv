TIGR00035	asp_race	aspartate racemase. Asparate racemases and some close homologs of unknown function are related to the more common glutamate racemases, but form a distinct evolutionary branch. This model identifies members of the aspartate racemase-related subset of amino acid racemases [Energy metabolism, Amino acids and amines].
TIGR00113	queA	S-adenosylmethionine:tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase. This model describes the enzyme for S-adenosylmethionine:tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase (QueA). QueA synthesizes Queuosine which is usually in the first position of the anticodon of tRNAs specific for asparagine, aspartate, histidine, and tyrosine [Protein synthesis, tRNA and rRNA base modification].
TIGR00150	T6A_YjeE	tRNA threonylcarbamoyl adenosine modification protein YjeE. This protein family belongs to a four-gene system responsible for the threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A) tRNA modification. Members of this family have a conserved nucleotide-binding motif GXXGXGKT and a nucleotide-binding fold. Member protein YjeE of Haemophilus influenzae (HI0065) was shown to have (weak) ATPase activity [Protein synthesis, tRNA and rRNA base modification].
TIGR00202	csrA	carbon storage regulator (csrA). Modulates the expression of genes in the glycogen biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis pathways by accelerating the 5'-to-3' degradation of these transcripts through selective RNA binding. The N-terminal end of the sequence (AA 11-45) contains the KH motif which is characteristic of a set of RNA-binding proteins [Energy metabolism, Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, Regulatory functions, RNA interactions].
TIGR00254	GGDEF	diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF) domain. The GGDEF domain is named for the motif GG[DE]EF shared by many proteins carrying the domain. There is evidence that the domain has diguanylate cyclase activity. Several proteins carrying this domain also carry domains with functions relating to environmental sensing. These include PleD, a response regulator protein involved in the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition in Caulobacter crescentus, and FixL, a heme-containing oxygen sensor protein [Regulatory functions, Small molecule interactions, Signal transduction, Other].
TIGR00281	TIGR00281	segregation and condensation protein B. Shown to be required for chromosome segregation and condensation in B. subtilis [Cellular processes, Cell division, DNA metabolism, Chromosome-associated proteins].
TIGR00306	apgM	2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, archaeal form. Experimentally characterized in archaea as 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase. This model describes a set of proteins in the Archaea (two each in Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus) and in Aquifex aeolicus (1 member) [Energy metabolism, Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis].
TIGR00392	ileS	isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. The isoleucyl tRNA synthetase (IleS) is a class I amino acyl-tRNA ligase and is particularly closely related to the valyl tRNA synthetase. This model may recognize IleS from every species, including eukaryotic cytosolic and mitochondrial forms [Protein synthesis, tRNA aminoacylation].
TIGR00400	mgtE	Mg2+ transporter (mgtE). This family of prokaryotic proteins models a class of Mg++ transporter first described in Bacillus firmus. May form a homodimer [Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds].
TIGR00465	ilvC	ketol-acid reductoisomerase. This is the second enzyme in the parallel isoleucine-valine biosynthetic pathway [Amino acid biosynthesis, Pyruvate family].
TIGR00546	lnt	apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase. This enzyme transfers the acyl group to lipoproteins in the lgt/lsp/lnt system which is found broadly in bacteria but not in archaea. This model represents one component of the "lipoprotein lgt/lsp/lnt system" genome property [Protein fate, Protein modification and repair].
TIGR00575	dnlj	DNA ligase, NAD-dependent. All proteins in this family with known functions are NAD-dependent DNA ligases. Functions of these proteins include DNA repair, DNA replication, and DNA recombination. This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University). The member of this family from Treponema pallidum differs in having three rather than just one copy of the BRCT (BRCA1 C Terminus) domain (pfam00533) at the C-terminus. It is included in the seed [DNA metabolism, DNA replication, recombination, and repair].
TIGR00630	uvra	excinuclease ABC, A subunit. This family is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily of proteins of which all members for which functions are known except the UvrA proteins are involved in the transport of material through membranes. UvrA orthologs are involved in the recognition of DNA damage as a step in nucleotide excision repair. This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University) [DNA metabolism, DNA replication, recombination, and repair].
TIGR00674	dapA	dihydrodipicolinate synthase. Dihydrodipicolinate synthase is a homotetrameric enzyme of lysine biosynthesis. E. coli has several paralogs closely related to dihydrodipicoline synthase (DapA), as well as the more distant N-acetylneuraminate lyase. In Pyrococcus horikoshii, the bidirectional best hit with E. coli is to an uncharacterized paralog of DapA, not DapA itself, and it is omitted from the seed. The putative members from the Chlamydias (pathogens with a parasitic metabolism) are easily the most divergent members of the multiple alignment [Amino acid biosynthesis, Aspartate family].
TIGR00704	NaPi_cotrn_rel	Na/Pi-cotransporter. This model describes essentially the full length of an uncharacterized protein from Bacillus subtilis and correponding lengths of longer proteins from E. coli and Treponema pallidum. PSI-BLAST analysis converges to demonstrate homology to one other group of proteins, type II sodium/phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransporters. A well-conserved repeated domain in this family, approximately 60 residues in length, is also repeated in the Na/Pi cotransporters, although with greater spacing between the repeats. The two families share additional homology in the region after the first repeat, share the properly of having extensive hydrophobic regions, and may be similar in function [Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds].
TIGR00706	SppA_dom	signal peptide peptidase SppA, 36K type. The related but duplicated, double-length protein SppA (protease IV) of E. coli was shown experimentally to degrade signal peptides as are released by protein processing and secretion. This protein shows stronger homology to the C-terminal region of SppA than to the N-terminal domain or to the related putative protease SuhB. The member of this family from Bacillus subtilis was shown to have properties consistent with a role in degrading signal peptides after cleavage from precursor proteins, although it was not demonstrated conclusively [Protein fate, Degradation of proteins, peptides, and glycopeptides].
TIGR00713	hemL	glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2,1-aminomutase. This enzyme, glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2,1-aminomutase (glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase, GSA aminotransferase), contains a pyridoxal phosphate attached at a Lys residue at position 283 of the seed alignment. It is in the family of class III aminotransferases [Biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers, Heme, porphyrin, and cobalamin].
TIGR00737	nifR3_yhdG	putative TIM-barrel protein, nifR3 family. This model represents one branch of COG0042 (Predicted TIM-barrel enzymes, possibly dehydrogenases, nifR3 family). This branch includes NifR3 itself, from Rhodobacter capsulatus. It excludes a broadly distributed but more sparsely populated subfamily that contains sll0926 from Synechocystis PCC6803, HI0634 from Haemophilus influenzae, and BB0225 from Borrelia burgdorferi. It also excludes a shorter and more distant archaeal subfamily.The function of nifR3, a member of this family, is unknown, but it is found in an operon with nitrogen-sensing two component regulators in Rhodobacter capsulatus.Members of this family show a distant relationship to alpha/beta (TIM) barrel enzymes such as dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and glycolate oxidase [Unknown function, General].
TIGR00738	rrf2_super	Rrf2 family protein. This model represents a superfamily of probable transcriptional regulators. One member, RRF2 of Desulfovibrio vulgaris is an apparent regulatory protein experimentally (MEDLINE:97293189). The N-terminal region appears related to the DNA-binding biotin repressor region of the BirA bifunctional according to results after three rounds of PSI-BLAST with a fairly high stringency [Unknown function, General].
TIGR00836	amt	ammonium transporter. The Ammonium Transporter (Amt) Family (TC 2.A.49) All functionally characterized members of the Amt family are ammonia or ammonium uptake transporters. Some, but not others, also transport methylammonium. The mechanism of energy coupling, if any, to methyl-NH2 or NH3 uptake by the AmtB protein of E. coli is not entirely clear. NH4+ uniport driven by the pmf, energy independent NH3 facilitation, and NH4+/K+ antiport have been proposed as possible transport mechanisms. In Corynebacterium glutamicum and Arabidopsis thaliana, uptake via the Amt1 homologues of AmtB has been reported to be driven by the pmf [Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds].
TIGR00909	2A0306	amino acid transporter. [Transport and binding proteins, Amino acids, peptides and amines].
TIGR00914	2A0601	heavy metal efflux pump, CzcA family. This model represents a family of H+/heavy metal cation antiporters. This family is one of several subfamilies within the scope of Pfam model pfam00873 [Cellular processes, Detoxification, Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds].
TIGR00933	2a38	potassium uptake protein, TrkH family. The proteins of the Trk family are derived from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeast and wheat. The proteins of E. coli K12 TrkH and TrkG as well as several yeast proteins have been functionally characterized.The E. coli TrkH and TrkG proteins are complexed to two peripheral membrane proteins, TrkA, an NAD-binding protein, and TrkE, an ATP-binding protein. This complex forms the potassium uptake system [Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds].
TIGR00966	3a0501s07	protein-export membrane protein SecF. This bacterial protein is always found with the homologous protein-export membrane protein SecD. In numerous lineages, this protein occurs as a SecDF fusion protein [Protein fate, Protein and peptide secretion and trafficking].
TIGR00988	hip	integration host factor, beta subunit. This protein forms a site-specific DNA-binding heterodimer with the homologous integration host factor alpha subunit. It is closely related to the DNA-binding protein HU [DNA metabolism, DNA replication, recombination, and repair].
TIGR00999	8a0102	Membrane Fusion Protein cluster 2 (function with RND porters). [Transport and binding proteins, Other].
TIGR01003	PTS_HPr_family	Phosphotransferase System HPr (HPr) Family. The HPr family are bacterial proteins (or domains of proteins) which function in phosphoryl transfer system (PTS) systems. They include energy-coupling components which catalyze sugar uptake via a group translocation mechanism. The functions of most of these proteins are not known, but they presumably function in PTS-related regulatory capacities. All seed members are stand-alone HPr proteins, although the model also recognizes HPr domains of PTS fusion proteins. This family includes the related NPr protein [Signal transduction, PTS].
TIGR01034	metK	S-adenosylmethionine synthetase. Tandem isozymes of this S-adenosylmethionine synthetase in E. coli are designated MetK and MetX [Central intermediary metabolism, Other].
TIGR01069	mutS2	MutS2 family protein. Function of MutS2 is unknown. It should not be considered a DNA mismatch repair protein. It is likely a DNA mismatch binding protein of unknown cellular function [DNA metabolism, Other].
TIGR01135	glmS	glucosamine--fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (isomerizing). The member from Methanococcus jannaschii contains an intein [Cell envelope, Biosynthesis and degradation of murein sacculus and peptidoglycan, Central intermediary metabolism, Amino sugars].
TIGR01138	cysM	cysteine synthase B. CysM differs from CysK in that it can also use thiosulfate instead of sulfide, to produce cysteine thiosulfonate instead of cysteine. Alternate name: O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase [Amino acid biosynthesis, Serine family].
TIGR01174	ftsA	cell division protein FtsA. This bacterial cell division protein interacts with FtsZ, the bacterial homolog of tubulin. It is an ATP-binding protein and shows structural similarities to actin and heat shock cognate protein 70 [Cellular processes, Cell division].
TIGR01221	rmlC	dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase. This enzyme participates in the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-rhamnose, often as a precursor to LPS O-antigen [Cell envelope, Biosynthesis and degradation of surface polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides].
TIGR01296	asd_B	aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (peptidoglycan organisms). Two closely related families of aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase are found. They differ by a deep split in phylogenetic and percent identity trees and in gap patterns. This model represents a branch more closely related to the USG-1 protein than to the other aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenases represented in model TIGR00978 [Amino acid biosynthesis, Aspartate family].
TIGR01309	L30P_arch	50S ribosomal protein L30P, archaeal. This model represents the archaeal ribosomal protein similar to longer (~ 250 residue) eukaryotic 60S ribosomal protein L7 and to the much shorter (~ 60 residue) bacterial 50S ribosomal protein L30. Protein naming follows the SwissProt designation as L30P, while the gene symbol rpmD follows TIGR usage [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification].
TIGR01407	dinG_rel	DnaQ family exonuclease/DinG family helicase, putative. This model represents a family of proteins in Gram-positive bacteria. The N-terminal region of about 200 amino acids resembles the epsilon subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III and the homologous region of the Gram-positive type DNA polymerase III alpha subunit. The epsilon subunit contains an exonuclease domain. The remainder of this protein family resembles a predicted ATP-dependent helicase, the DNA damage-inducible protein DinG of E. coli [DNA metabolism, DNA replication, recombination, and repair].
TIGR01417	PTS_I_fam	phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase. This model recognizes a distinct clade of phophoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent enzymes. Most members are known or deduced to function as the phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase (or enzyme I) of PTS sugar transport systems. However, some species with both a member of this family and a homolog of the phosphocarrier protein HPr lack a IIC component able to serve as a permease. An HPr homolog designated NPr has been implicated in the regulation of nitrogen assimilation, which demonstrates that not all phosphotransferase system components are associated directly with PTS transport.
TIGR01420	pilT_fam	pilus retraction protein PilT. This model represents the PilT subfamily of proteins related to GspE, a protein involved in type II secretion (also called the General Secretion Pathway). PilT is an apparent cytosolic ATPase associated with type IV pilus systems. It is not required for pilin biogenesis, but is required for twitching motility and social gliding behaviors, shown in some species, powered by pilus retraction. Members of this family may be found in some species that type IV pili but have related structures for DNA uptake and natural transformation [Cell envelope, Surface structures, Cellular processes, Chemotaxis and motility].
TIGR01444	fkbM_fam	methyltransferase, FkbM family. Members of this family are characterized by two well-conserved short regions separated by a variable in both sequence and length. The first of the two regions is found in a large number of proteins outside this subfamily, a number of which have been characterized as methyltransferases. One member of the present family, FkbM, was shown to be required for a specific methylation in the biosynthesis of the immunosuppressant FK506 in Streptomyces strain MA6548.
TIGR01463	mtaA_cmuA	methyltransferase, MtaA/CmuA family. This subfamily is closely related to, yet is distinct from, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.37). It includes two isozymes from Methanosarcina barkeri of methylcobalamin--coenzyme M methyltransferase. It also includes a chloromethane utilization protein, CmuA, which transfers the methyl group of chloromethane to a corrinoid protein.
TIGR01575	rimI	ribosomal-protein-alanine acetyltransferase. Members of this model belong to the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily. This model covers prokarotes and the archaea. The seed contains a characterized accession for Gram negative E. coli. An untraceable characterized accession (PIR|S66013) for Gram positive B. subtilis scores well (205.0) in the full alignment. Characterized members are lacking in the archaea. Noise cutoff (72.4) was set to exclude M. loti paralog of rimI. Trusted cutoff (80.0) was set at next highest scoring member in the mini-database [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification].
TIGR01706	NAPA	periplasmic nitrate reductase, large subunit. This model represents the large subunit of a family of nitrate reductases found in proteobacteria which are localized to the periplasm. This subunit binds molybdopterin and contains a twin-arginine motif at the N-terminus. The protein associates with NapB, a soluble heme-containing protein and NapC, a membrane-bound cytochrome c. The periplasmic nitrate reductases are not involved in the assimilation of nitrogen, and are not directly involved in the formation of electrochemical gradients (i.e. respiration) either. Rather, the purpose of this enzyme is either dissimilatory (i.e. to dispose of excess reductive equivalents) or indirectly respiratory by virtue of the consumption of electrons derived from NADH via the proton translocating NADH dehydrogenase. The enzymes from Alicagenes eutrophus and Paracoccus pantotrophus have been characterized. In E. coli (as well as other organisms) this gene is part of a large nitrate reduction operon (napFDAGHBC) [Energy metabolism, Aerobic, Energy metabolism, Electron transport, Central intermediary metabolism, Nitrogen metabolism].
TIGR01799	CM_T	chorismate mutase domain of T-protein. This model represents the chorismate mutase domain of the gamma proteobacterial "T-protein" which consists of an N-terminal chorismate mutase domain and a C-terminal prephenate dehydrogenase domain [Amino acid biosynthesis, Aromatic amino acid family].
TIGR01830	3oxo_ACP_reduc	3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase. This model represents 3-oxoacyl-[ACP] reductase, also called 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, an enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis [Fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, Biosynthesis].
TIGR01969	minD_arch	cell division ATPase MinD, archaeal. This model represents the archaeal branch of the MinD family. MinD, a weak ATPase, works in bacteria with MinC as a generalized cell division inhibitor and, through interaction with MinE, prevents septum placement inappropriate sites. Often several members of this family are found in archaeal genomes, and the function is uncharacterized. More distantly related proteins include flagellar biosynthesis proteins and ParA chromosome partitioning proteins. The exact roles of the various archaeal MinD homologs are unknown.
TIGR02026	BchE	magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester anaerobic oxidative cyclase. This model respresents the cobalamin-dependent oxidative cyclase responsible for forming the distinctive E-ring of the chlorin ring system under anaerobic conditions. This step is essential in the biosynthesis of both bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll under anaerobic conditions (a separate enzyme, AcsF, acts under aerobic conditions). This model identifies two clades of sequences, one from photosynthetic, non-cyanobacterial bacteria and another including Synechocystis and several non-photosynthetic bacteria. The function of the Synechocystis gene is supported by gene clustering with other photosynthetic genes, so the purpose of the gene in the non-photosynthetic bacteria is uncertain. Note that homologs of this gene are not found in plants which rely solely on the aerobic cyclase.
TIGR02095	glgA	glycogen/starch synthase, ADP-glucose type. This family consists of glycogen (or starch) synthases that use ADP-glucose (EC 2.4.1.21), rather than UDP-glucose (EC 2.4.1.11) as in animals, as the glucose donor. This enzyme is found in bacteria and plants. Whether the name given is glycogen synthase or starch synthase depends on context, and therefore on substrate [Energy metabolism, Biosynthesis and degradation of polysaccharides].
TIGR02120	GspF	type II secretion system protein F. This membrane protein is a component of the terminal branch complex of the general secretion pathway (GSP), also known as the"Type II" secretion pathway. The GSP transports proteins (generally virulence-associated cell wall hydrolases) across the outer membrase of the bacterial cell. Transport across the inner membrane is often, but not exclusively handled by the Sec system. This model was constructed from the broader subfamily model, pfam00482 which includes components of pilin complexes (PilC) as well as other related genes. GspF is nearly always gene clustered with other GSP subunits. Some genes from Xylella and Xanthomonas strains score below the trusted cutoff due to excessive divergence from the family such that a sequence from Deinococcus which does not appear to be GspF scores higher [Protein fate, Protein and peptide secretion and trafficking].
TIGR02154	PhoB	phosphate regulon transcriptional regulatory protein PhoB. PhoB is a DNA-binding response regulator protein acting with PhoR in a 2-component system responding to phosphate ion. PhoB acts as a positive regulator of gene expression for phosphate-related genes such as phoA, phoS, phoE and ugpAB as well as itself. It is often found proximal to genes for the high-affinity phosphate ABC transporter (pstSCAB; GenProp0190) and presumably regulates these as well [Regulatory functions, DNA interactions, Signal transduction, Two-component systems].
TIGR02197	heptose_epim	ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose-6-epimerase. This family consists of examples of ADP-L-glycero-D-mannoheptose-6-epimerase, an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of the inner core of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for Gram-negative bacteria. This enzyme is homologous to UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (TIGR01179) and belongs to the NAD dependent epimerase/dehydratase family (pfam01370) [Cell envelope, Biosynthesis and degradation of surface polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides].
TIGR02199	rfaE_dom_II	rfaE bifunctional protein, domain II. RfaE is a protein involved in the biosynthesis of ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, a precursor for LPS inner core biosynthesis. RfaE is a bifunctional protein in E. coli, and separate proteins in some other genome. Domain I (TIGR02198) is suggested to act in D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate biosynthesis, while domain II (this family) adds ADP to yield ADP-D-glycero-D-manno-heptose [Cell envelope, Biosynthesis and degradation of surface polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides].
TIGR02211	LolD_lipo_ex	lipoprotein releasing system, ATP-binding protein. This model represents LolD, a member of the ABC transporter family (pfam00005). LolD is involved in localization of lipoproteins in some bacteria. It works with a transmembrane protein LolC, which in some species is a paralogous pair LolC and LolE. Depending on whether the residue immediately following the new, modified N-terminal Cys residue, the nascent lipoprotein may be carried further by LolA and LolB to the outer membrane, or remain at the inner membrane. The top scoring proteins excluded by this model include homologs from the archaeal genus Methanosarcina [Protein fate, Protein and peptide secretion and trafficking].
TIGR02253	CTE7	HAD superfamily (subfamily IA) hydrolase, TIGR02253. This family of sequences from archaea and metazoans includes the human uncharacterized protein CTE7. Pyrococcus species appear to have three different forms of this enzyme, so it is unclear whether all members of this family have the same function. This family is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases which are characterized by three conserved sequence motifs. By virtue of an alpha helical domain in-between the first and second conserved motif, this family is a member of subfamily IA (TIGR01549).
TIGR02348	GroEL	chaperonin GroL. This family consists of GroEL, the larger subunit of the GroEL/GroES cytosolic chaperonin. It is found in bacteria, organelles derived from bacteria, and occasionally in the Archaea. The bacterial GroEL/GroES group I chaperonin is replaced a group II chaperonin, usually called the thermosome in the Archaeota and CCT (chaperone-containing TCP) in the Eukaryota. GroEL, thermosome subunits, and CCT subunits all fall under the scope of pfam00118 [Protein fate, Protein folding and stabilization].
TIGR02380	ECA_wecA	undecaprenyl-phosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl 1-phosphatetransferase. Members of this family are the WecA enzyme of enterobacterial common antigen biosynthesis, undecaprenyl-phosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl 1-phosphatetransferase. This family represents one narrow clade, and closely related sequences outside this clade may represent enzymes that catalyze the same specific reaction, but in the context of different pathways. A His-rich motif in a cytosolic loop of this integral membrane protein, shown critical to enzymatic activity for WecA (see ref ) is variously present or absent in the clade that includes Bacillus subtilis TagO teichoic acid biosynthesis enzyme, which may catalyze the same reaction as WecA [Cell envelope, Biosynthesis and degradation of surface polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides].
TIGR02420	dksA	RNA polymerase-binding protein DksA. The model that is the basis for this family describes a small, pleiotropic protein, DksA (DnaK suppressor A), originally named as a multicopy suppressor of temperature sensitivity of dnaKJ mutants. DksA mutants are defective in quorum sensing, virulence, etc. DksA is now understood to bind RNA polymerase directly and modulate its response to small molecules to control the level of transcription of rRNA. Nearly all members of this family are in the Proteobacteria. Whether the closest homologs outside the Proteobacteria function equivalently is unknown. The low value set for the noise cutoff allows identification of possible DksA proteins from outside the proteobacteria. TIGR02419 describes a closely related family of short sequences usually found in prophage regions of proteobacterial genomes or in known phage [Transcription, Transcription factors, Regulatory functions, Small molecule interactions].
TIGR02534	mucon_cyclo	muconate and chloromuconate cycloisomerases. This model encompasses muconate cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.1) and chloromuconate cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.7), enzymes that often overlap in specificity. It excludes more distantly related proteins such as mandelate racemase (5.1.2.2).
TIGR02618	tyr_phenol_ly	tyrosine phenol-lyase. This model describes a group of tyrosine phenol-lyase (4.1.99.2) (beta-tyrosinase), a pyridoxal-phosphate enzyme closely related to tryptophanase (4.1.99.1) (see model TIGR02617). Both belong to the beta-eliminating lyase family (pfam01212) [Energy metabolism, Amino acids and amines].
TIGR02639	ClpA	ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP-binding subunit clpA. [Protein fate, Degradation of proteins, peptides, and glycopeptides].
TIGR02789	nickel_nikB	nickel ABC transporter, permease subunit NikB. This family consists of the NikB family of nickel ABC transporter permeases. Operons that contain this protein also contain a homologous permease subunit NikC. Nickel is used in cells as part of urease or certain hydrogenases or superoxide dismutases [Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds].
TIGR02800	propeller_TolB	tol-pal system beta propeller repeat protein TolB. Members of this protein family are the TolB periplasmic protein of Gram-negative bacteria. TolB is part of the Tol-Pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein) multiprotein complex, comprising five envelope proteins, TolQ, TolR, TolA, TolB and Pal, which form two complexes. The TolQ, TolR and TolA inner-membrane proteins interact via their transmembrane domains. The {beta}-propeller domain of the periplasmic protein TolB is responsible for its interaction with Pal. TolB also interacts with the outer-membrane peptidoglycan-associated proteins Lpp and OmpA. TolA undergoes a conformational change in response to changes in the proton-motive force, and interacts with Pal in an energy-dependent manner. The C-terminal periplasmic domain of TolA also interacts with the N-terminal domain of TolB. The Tol-PAL system is required for bacterial outer membrane integrity. E. coli TolB is involved in the tonB-independent uptake of group A colicins (colicins A, E1, E2, E3 and K), and is necessary for the colicins to reach their respective targets after initial binding to the bacteria. It is also involved in uptake of filamentous DNA. Study of its structure suggest that the TolB protein might be involved in the recycling of peptidoglycan or in its covalent linking with lipoproteins. The Tol-Pal system is also implicated in pathogenesis of E. coli, Haemophilus ducreyi , Salmonella enterica and Vibrio cholerae, but the mechanism(s) is unclear [Transport and binding proteins, Other, Cellular processes, Pathogenesis].
TIGR02804	ExbD_2	TonB system transport protein ExbD, group 2. Members of this family are Gram-negative bacterial inner membrane proteins, generally designated ExbD, related to the TolR family modeled by TIGRFAMs TIGR02801. Members always are encoded next to a protein designated ExbB (TIGR02797), related to the TolQ family modeled by TIGRFAMs TIGR02796. ExbD and ExbB together form a proton channel through which they can harness the proton-motive force to energize TonB, which in turn energizes TonB-dependent receptors in the outer membrane. TonB-dependent receptors with known specificity tend to import siderophores or vitamin B12. A TonB system and Tol-Pal system often will co-exist in a single bacterial genome.
TIGR02818	adh_III_F_hyde	S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase/class III alcohol dehydrogenase. The members of this protein family show dual function. First, they remove formaldehyde, a toxic metabolite, by acting as S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase (1.1.1.284). S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione can form spontaneously from formaldehyde and glutathione, and so this enzyme previously was designated glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. These same proteins are also designated alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) of class III, for activities that do not require glutathione; they tend to show poor activity for ethanol among their various substrate alcohols [Cellular processes, Detoxification, Energy metabolism, Fermentation].
TIGR02937	sigma70-ECF	RNA polymerase sigma factor, sigma-70 family. This model encompasses all varieties of the sigma-70 type sigma factors including the ECF subfamily. A number of sigma factors have names with a different number than 70 (i.e. sigma-38), but in fact, all except for the Sigma-54 family (TIGR02395) are included within this family. Several PFAM models hit segments of these sequences including Sigma-70 region 2 (pfam04542) and Sigma-70, region 4 (pfam04545), but not always above their respective trusted cutoffs.
TIGR02966	phoR_proteo	phosphate regulon sensor kinase PhoR. Members of this protein family are the regulatory histidine kinase PhoR associated with the phosphate ABC transporter in most Proteobacteria. Related proteins from Gram-positive organisms are not included in this model. The phoR gene usually is adjacent to the response regulator phoB gene (TIGR02154) [Signal transduction, Two-component systems].
TIGR02977	phageshock_pspA	phage shock protein A. Members of this family are the phage shock protein PspA, from the phage shock operon. This is a narrower family than the set of PspA and its homologs, sometimes several in a genome, as described by pfam04012. PspA appears to maintain the protonmotive force under stress conditions that include overexpression of certain phage secretins, heat shock, ethanol, and protein export defects [Cellular processes, Adaptations to atypical conditions].
TIGR02981	phageshock_pspE	phage shock operon rhodanese PspE. Members of this very narrowly defined protein family are proteins active as rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1) and found in the extended variants of the phage shock protein (psp operon) in Escherichia coli and a few closely related species. Note that the designation phage shock protein PspE has been applied, incorrectly, in many instances where the genome lacks the phage shock regulon entirely.
TIGR02984	Sig-70_plancto1	RNA polymerase sigma-70 factor, Planctomycetaceae-specific subfamily 1. This group of sigma factors are members of the sigma-70 family (TIGR02937) and are apparently found only in the Planctomycetaceae family including the genuses Gemmata and Pirellula (in which seven sequences are found).
TIGR03026	NDP-sugDHase	nucleotide sugar dehydrogenase. Enzymes in this family catalyze the NAD-dependent alcohol-to-acid oxidation of nucleotide-linked sugars. Examples include UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (1.1.1.22) , GDP-mannose 6-dehydrogenase (1.1.1.132) , UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 6-dehydrogenase (1.1.1.136), UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminuronic acid dehydrogenase and UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acid dehydrogenase. These enzymes are most often involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and are often found in operons devoted to that purpose. All of these enzymes contain three Pfam domains, pfam03721, pfam00984, and pfam03720 for the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal regions respectively.
TIGR03150	fabF	beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase II. 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 2 (KAS-II, FabF) is involved in the condensation step of fatty acid biosynthesis in which the malonyl donor group is decarboxylated and the resulting carbanion used to attack and extend the acyl group attached to the acyl carrier protein. Most genomes encoding fatty acid biosynthesis contain a number of condensing enzymes, often of all three types: 1, 2 and 3. Synthase 2 is mechanistically related to synthase 1 (KAS-I, FabB) containing a number of absolutely conserved catalytic residues in common. This model is based primarily on genes which are found in apparent operons with other essential genes of fatty acid biosynthesis (GenProp0681). The large gap between the trusted cutoff and the noise cutoff contains many genes which are not found adjacent to genes of the fatty acid pathway in genomes that often also contain a better hit to this model. These genes may be involved in other processes such as polyketide biosyntheses. Some genomes contain more than one above-trusted hit to this model which may result from recent paralogous expansions. Second hits to this model which are not next to other fatty acid biosynthesis genes may be involved in other processes. FabB sequences should fall well below the noise cutoff of this model [Fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, Biosynthesis].
TIGR03175	AllD	ureidoglycolate dehydrogenase. This enzyme converts ureidoglycolate to oxalureate in the non-urea-forming catabolism of allantoin (GenProp0687). The pathway has been characterized in E. coli and is observed in the genomes of Entercoccus faecalis and Bacillus licheniformis.
TIGR03227	PhnS	2-aminoethylphosphonate ABC transporter, periplasmic 2-aminoethylphosphonate binding protein. This ABC transporter periplasmic substrate binding protein component is found in a region of the salmonella typhimurium LT2 genome responsible for the catabolism of 2-aminoethylphosphonate via the phnWX pathway (GenProp0238). The protein contains a match to pfam01547 for the "Bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein" domain.
TIGR03367	queuosine_QueD	queuosine biosynthesis protein QueD. Members of this protein family, closely related to eukaryotic 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase enzymes, are the QueD protein of queuosine biosynthesis. Queuosine is a hypermodified base in the wobble position of tRNAs for Tyr, His, Asp, and Asn in many species. This modification, although widespread, appears not to be important for viability. The queuosine precursor made by this enzyme may be converted instead to archeaosine as in some Archaea [Protein synthesis, tRNA and rRNA base modification].
TIGR03508	decahem_SO	decaheme c-type cytochrome, DmsE family. Members of this family are small, decaheme c-type cytochromes, related DmsE of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, which has been shown to be part of an anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase.
TIGR03529	GldK_short	gliding motility-associated lipoprotein GldK. Members of this protein family are exclusive to the Bacteroidetes phylum (previously Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides). GldK is a lipoprotein linked to a type of rapid surface gliding motility found in certain Bacteroidetes, such as Flavobacterium johnsoniae. Knockouts of GldK abolish the gliding phenotype. GldK is homologous to GldJ. This model represents a GldK homolog in Cytophaga hutchinsonii and several other species that has a different, shorter architecture than that found in Flavobacterium johnsoniae and related species (represented by (TIGR03525). Gliding motility appears closely linked to chitin utilization in the model species Flavobacterium johnsoniae. Bacteroidetes with members of this protein family appear to have all of the genes associated with gliding motility.
TIGR03540	DapC_direct	LL-diaminopimelate aminotransferase. This clade of the pfam00155 superfamily of aminotransferases includes several which are adjacent to elements of the lysine biosynthesis via diaminopimelate pathway (GenProp0125). Every member of this clade is from a genome which possesses most of the lysine biosynthesis pathway but lacks any of the known aminotransferases, succinylases, desuccinylases, acetylases or deacetylases typical of the acylated versions of this pathway nor do they have the direct, NADPH-dependent enzyme (ddh). Although there is no experimental characterization of any of the sequences in this clade, a direct pathway is known in plants and Chlamydia and the clade containing the Chlamydia gene is a neighboring one in the same pfam00155 superfamily so it seems quite reasonable that these enzymes catalyze the same transformation.
TIGR03628	arch_S11P	archaeal ribosomal protein S11P. This model describes exclusively the archaeal ribosomal protein S11P. It excludes homologous ribosomal proteins S14 from eukaryotes and S11 from bacteria [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification].
TIGR03632	bact_S11	30S ribosomal protein S11. This model describes the bacterial 30S ribosomal protein S11. Cutoffs are set such that the model excludes archaeal and eukaryotic ribosomal proteins, but many chloroplast and mitochondrial equivalents of S11 are detected [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification].
TIGR03696	Rhs_assc_core	RHS repeat-associated core domain. This model represents a conserved unique core sequence shared by large numbers of proteins. It is occasional in the Archaea Methanosarcina barkeri) but common in bacteria and eukaryotes. Most fall into two large classes. One class consists of long proteins in which two classes of repeats are abundant: an FG-GAP repeat (pfam01839) class, and an RHS repeat (pfam05593) or YD repeat (TIGR01643). This class includes secreted bacterial insecticidal toxins and intercellular signalling proteins such as the teneurins in animals. The other class consists of uncharacterized proteins shorter than 400 amino acids, where this core domain of about 75 amino acids tends to occur in the N-terminal half. Over twenty such proteins are found in Pseudomonas putida alone; little sequence similarity or repeat structure is found among these proteins outside the region modeled by this domain.
TIGR03710	OAFO_sf	2-oxoacid:acceptor oxidoreductase, alpha subunit. This family of proteins contains a C-terminal thiamine diphosphate (TPP) binding domain typical of flavodoxin/ferredoxin oxidoreductases (pfam01855) as well as an N-terminal domain similar to the gamma subunit of the same group of oxidoreductases (pfam01558). The genes represented by this model are always found in association with a neighboring gene for a beta subunit (TIGR02177) which also occurs in a 4-subunit (alpha/beta/gamma/ferredoxin) version of the system. This alpha/gamma plus beta structure was used to define the set of sequences to include in this model. This pair of genes is not consistantly observed in proximity to any electron acceptor genes, but is found next to putative ferredoxins or ferredoxin-domain proteins in Azoarcus sp. EbN1, Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110, Frankia sp. CcI3, Rhodoferax ferrireducens DSM 15236, Rhodopseudomonas palustris BisB5, Os, Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 and Streptomyces clavuligerus. Other potential acceptors are also sporadically observed in close proximity including ferritin-like proteins, reberythrin, peroxiredoxin and a variety of other flavin and iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins. The phylogenetic distribution of this family encompasses archaea, a number of deeply-branching bacterial clades and only a small number of firmicutes and proteobacteria. The enzyme from Sulfolobus has been characterized with respect to its substrate specificity which is described as wide, encompassing various 2-oxoacids such as 2-oxoglutarate, 2-oxobutyrate and pyruvate. The enzyme from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus has been shown to have a high specificity towards 2-oxoglutarate and is one of the key enzymes in the reverse TCA cycle in this organism. Furthermore, considering its binding of coenzyme A, it can be reasonably inferred that the product of the reaction is succinyl-CoA. The genes for this enzyme in Prevotella intermedia 17, Persephonella marina EX-H1 and Picrophilus torridus DSM 9790 are in close proximity to a variety of TCA cycle genes. Persephonella marina and P. torridus are believed to encode complete TCA cycles, and none of these contains the lipoate-based 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1/E2/E3) system. That system is presumed to be replaced by this one. In fact, the lipoate system is absent in most organisms possessing a member of this family, providing additional circumstantial evidence that many of these enzymes are capable of acting as 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases and
TIGR03716	R_switched_YkoY	integral membrane protein, YkoY family. Rfam model RF00080 describes a structured RNA element called the yybP-ykoY leader, or SraF, which may precede one or several genes in a genome. Members of this highly hydrophobic protein family often are preceded by a yybP-ykoY leader, which may serve as a riboswitch. From the larger group of TerC homologs (pfam03741), this subfamily contains proteins YceF and YkoY from Bacillus subtilis. A transport function is proposed.
TIGR03819	heli_sec_ATPase	helicase/secretion neighborhood ATPase. Members of this protein family comprise a distinct clade of putative ATPase associated with an integral membrane complex likely to act in pilus formation, secretion, or conjugal transfer. The association of most members with a nearby gene for a DEAH-box helicase suggests a role in conjugal transfer.
TIGR03869	F420-0_ABCperm	proposed F420-0 ABC transporter, permease protein. his small clade of ABC-type transporter permease protein components is found as a three gene cassette along with a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (TIGR03868) and an ATPase (TIGR03873). The organisms containing this cassette are all Actinobacteria and all contain numerous genes requiring the coenzyme F420. This model was defined based on five such organisms, four of which are lacking all F420 biosynthetic capability save the final side-chain polyglutamate attachment step (via the gene cofE: TIGR01916). In Jonesia denitrificans DSM 20603 and marine actinobacterium PHSC20C1 this cassette is in an apparent operon with the cofE gene and, in PHSC20C1, also with an F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (TIGR03554). Based on these observations we propose that this permease protein is a component of a F420-0 (that is, F420 lacking only the polyglutamate tail) transporter.
TIGR04007	wcaI	colanic acid biosynthesis glycosyl transferase WcaI. This gene is one of the glycosyl transferases involved in the biosynthesis of colanic acid, an exopolysaccharide expressed in Enterobacteraceae species.
TIGR04131	Bac_Flav_CTERM	gliding motility-associated C-terminal domain. This model describes a protein homology domain unique to, and greatly expanded in, the Bacteriodetes. Species in this lineage include several, such as Cytophaga hutchinsonii and Flavobacterium johnsoniae, that exhibit a poorly understood rapid gliding phenotype. Several members of this protein family are found in operons with other genes whose loss leads to a loss a this motility. Proteins with this domain frequently pair with members of family TIGR03519, whether one such pair or many occur in a genome. More than 30 members may occur in one genome.
TIGR04182	glyco_TIGR04182	glycosyltransferase, TIGR04182 family. Members of this family are glycosyltransferases restricted to the archaea. All but two members are from species with the PGF-CTERM/archaeosortase A system, a proposed maturation system for exported, glycosylated proteins as are found often in S-layers.
TIGR04183	Por_Secre_tail	Por secretion system C-terminal sorting domain. Species that include Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Flavobacterium johnsoniae, Cytophaga hutchinsonii, Gramella forsetii, Prevotella intermedia, and Salinibacter ruber average twenty or more copies of a C-terminal domain, modeled by This model, associated with sorting to the outer membrane and covalent modification.
TIGR04256	GxxExxY	GxxExxY protein. Members of this protein family average about 130 residues in length and include an almost perfectly conserved motif GxxExxY. Members occur in a wide range of prokaryotes, including Proteobacteria, Perrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Archaea, etc.
TIGR04367	HpnR_B12_rSAM	hopanoid C-3 methylase HpnR. Members of this are family are a B12-binding domain/radical SAM domain protein required for 3-methylhopanoid production. Activity was confirmed by mutant phenotype by disrupting this gene in Methylococcus capsulatus strain Bath. This protein family should only occur in genomes that encode a squalene-hopene cyclase (see TIGR01507) [Fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, Biosynthesis].
